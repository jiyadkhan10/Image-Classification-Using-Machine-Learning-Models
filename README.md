# Image-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
# Course
DS3002	Data Mining <br />

# Objective
The goal of this assignment is to let you explore and understand Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for image classification in the CIFAR-10 dataset. <br />
# Description
You’re required to come up with at least 2 different ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc.) along with a comparative analysis (e.g., accuracy, efficiency, simplicity, etc.). <br />
<br />
Note: variants of any ML algorithm (e.g., Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc.) will be considered as only one model.


# Languages
1. Python <br />
